<h4>Honor statement:</h4>
<p>I have not cheated in any way when doing this assignment, I did it on my own. I may have asked questions about the assignment on Piazza, I know that’s totally fine and even encouraged. I also already know that this class is graded on a curve. I realize that if I cheat and by some miracle not get caught, any increase in my grade will in turn shift the curve and result in lower grades for my classmates. Any undeserved extra grade would come at the cost of all others. That’s horrible! I would never do it.</p>

<p>As far as our results show that the alising happened in both spatial and frequency domains. I just observed that stuff are more far away 
    from our sight, the more blurred appears, also, the more aliasing is, the more far the thing away from the sight. In the frequency domain, 
    it is easy to find that more loss happened and change in detail on the outer part. These are the high frequency components have corrupted.
    Low pass image has not too much aliasing and frequency compared with before.

<p>In this part, we can only find the aliasing happened in the things far from our sight. However, more aliasing happened in the interactions
    of the esges. In the high frequency domain, the details of almost out places shouws lost more information compared with before, in this way
    the high frequency components have been corrupted. Also, about the low pass frequency domain, which shows that it will begin to aliased, and it can say that
    LP did not remain most of the information, the frequency still remain its previous shape.

<p>The Gasussion kernel I used to anti-aliased 1/2 subsampled HP size is 12, and sd is 2. The Gasussion kernel I used to anti-aliased 1/4 subsampled HP size is 15, and sd is 1.5. 
    It removes high frequence components and preserve low frequency component.
    When anti-aliased, the image of high pass frequency is about a state that is released outward, but the image of low pass frequency
    is about concentrating inward, in sharp contrast to the high pass frequency.

<p>As far as the result shows that the optimal version is better than other version, because others vesions may contain more information that
     we may not need actually, also, the optimal version still have some places that need to fix.
